**Problem Statement:**

Consider a governance system with $N$ token holders (voters) interacting over discrete time steps $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T$. Each voter $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ has token holdings $H_i(t)$, which determine their voting power under different mechanisms. The system processes proposals $P_j$ that can modify parameters of external systems (e.g., tax rates, allocation funds).

The simulation models the evolution of governance dynamics under different voting mechanisms: simple voting, quadratic voting, and delegation-based voting. Proposals are submitted probabilistically and voted on by participating voters. The goal is to analyze the impact of voting mechanisms on participation rates, wealth distribution (Gini coefficient), proposal success, and treasury management.

At each time step $t$, with probability $p_{\text{submit}}$, a proposal $P_j$ is generated by a random voter. Each participating voter casts their vote based on the voting mechanism:

- **Simple Voting**: $Vote_i = H_i(t)$ if in favor, $-H_i(t)$ if oppose
- **Quadratic Voting**: $Vote_i = \sqrt{H_i(t)}$ if in favor, $-\sqrt{H_i(t)}$ if oppose
- **Delegation**: Votes are cast via delegated representatives

The proposal passes if $\frac{V_j(t)}{\sum_{i} |Vote_i|} > \theta_j$, where $V_j(t) = \sum_{i} Vote_i$.

If passed, the treasury allocates funds or modifies parameters: $Tr(t+1) = Tr(t) - A_j(t)$.

The simulation tracks metrics such as voter participation $p_{\text{part}}(t)$, Gini coefficient $G(t)$, and proposal success rates.

**Solution Approach (Simulation):**

The problem is solved through a discrete-time simulation with the following steps:

1. **Initialization (t=0):**
   - Set voter token holdings $H_i(0)$, possibly importing from external simulations.
   - Initialize treasury $Tr(0)$, voting mechanisms.
   - Compute initial Gini coefficient $G(0)$.

2. **Iteration (for t = 0 to T-1):**
   - **Voter Participation:** Each voter participates with probability $p_{\text{part}}(t)$.
   - **Proposal Submission:** With probability $p_{\text{submit}}$, generate a new proposal $P_j$.
   - **Voting:** Each participating voter casts their vote based on the selected voting mechanism, calculating $Vote_i$.
   - **Proposal Resolution:** Aggregate votes $V_j(t)$ and check against threshold $\theta_j$. If passed, execute changes (e.g., treasury allocation $Tr(t+1) = Tr(t) - A_j(t)$).
   - **Metrics Update:** Recalculate participation rate, Gini coefficient, and other metrics.
   - **Next Step:** Update token holdings if modified by proposal execution.

3. **Analysis:** After $T$ steps, analyze the collected data, including:
   - Time series of voter participation $p_{\text{part}}(t)$.
   - Evolution of Gini coefficient $G(t)$.
   - Proposal success rates and treasury changes.
   - Comparative analysis across voting mechanisms (simple, quadratic, delegation).

**Mathematical Representation of Voting Mechanisms:**

The voting mechanisms introduce different incentive structures:

- **Simple Voting:** Direct proportionality to holdings, potentially favoring large holders.
- **Quadratic Voting:** Diminishing returns on additional tokens, promoting more equitable influence.
- **Delegation:** Introduces representative structures, modeling liquid democracy.

**Dynamic Treasury Allocation:**
When a proposal passes, funds are allocated proportional to the change magnitude:
$$A_j(t) = \min(Tr(t), c \cdot |\Delta p_j|)$$

where $\Delta p_j$ is the parameter change proposed, and $c$ is a scaling constant.

**Gini Coefficient Calculation:**
The Gini coefficient measures wealth inequality among voters:
$$G(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} |H_i(t) - H_k(t)|}{2 N^2 \bar{H}(t)}$$

where $\bar{H}(t)$ is the average holdings.

**Output and Analysis:**

The simulation generates time series data that can be used to analyze:
- **Participation Dynamics:** How voting mechanisms affect voter engagement.
- **Inequality Evolution:** Impact on wealth distribution through governance decisions.
- **Proposal Efficacy:** Success rates and their implications for system changes.
- **Treasury Sustainability:** Allocation patterns and fund depletion rates.

This mathematical formulation provides a framework for understanding complex interactions in token-based governance systems, enabling predictions of real-world DAO behaviors under different design choices.
