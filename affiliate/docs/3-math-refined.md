**Problem Statement:**

Consider a system with $N$ distinct tokens and $M$ affiliates interacting over discrete time steps $t = 0, 1, 2, \dots, T$. Each token $i \in \{1, \dots, N\}$ has a supply $S_i(t)$ and a price $P_i(t)$ at time $t$. The price of each token is determined by a bonding curve function $f_i$, which can change over time. Specifically, the price depends on the current supply and possibly time-varying parameters $\theta_i(t)$:

$$P_i(t) = f_i(S_i(t), \theta_i(t))$$

The bonding curve function $f_i$ can be one of several predefined functions (e.g., linear, exponential, sigmoid, root, inverse), and the specific function used for token $i$ can change at discrete intervals. The parameters $\theta_i(t)$ associated with the active bonding curve function can also change at discrete intervals.

Each affiliate $j \in \{1, \dots, M\}$ has a base currency balance $B_j(t)$, a wallet holding balances of each token $W_{j,i}(t)$ for token $i$, and a commission rate $C_j(t)$.

At each time step, affiliates can perform buy or sell transactions for each token.

**1. Affiliate Actions:** For each affiliate $j$ and token $i$, the probability of buying is modeled as:

     \begin{equation} \label{eq:buy_prob}
     P_{buy, j, i}(t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(k_1 (P_i(t) - P_{target, i}) + k_2 B_j(t))}}
     \end{equation}

     A similar model (with different parameters) determines the probability of selling,  $P_{sell, j, i}(t)$. If the affiliate decides to buy (based on a Bernoulli draw with probability  $P_{buy, j, i}(t)$), they attempt to buy a quantity  $\Delta s$.  If they decide to sell, they attempt to sell a quantity  $\Delta s$. (The exact quantity determination needs further specification).

**2. Token Transactions:**

      *If affiliate j buys  Δs  units of token i:*

      \begin{align}
      B_j(t+1) &= B_j(t) - \Delta s \cdot P_i(t) + Commission_{j,i}(t) \\
      W_{j,i}(t+1) &= W_{j,i}(t) + \Delta s \\
      S_i(t+1) &= S_i(t) + \Delta s
      \end{align}

      *where the commission is calculated as:*

      \begin{equation}
      Commission_{j,i}(t) = C_j(t) \cdot \Delta s \cdot P_i(t)
      \end{equation}

      *If affiliate j sells  Δs  units of token i:*

       \begin{align}
      B_j(t+1) &= B_j(t) + \Delta s \cdot P_i(t) + Commission_{j,i}(t) \\
      W_{j,i}(t+1) &= W_{j,i}(t) - \Delta s \\
      S_i(t+1) &= S_i(t) - \Delta s
      \end{align}
      *where the commission is calculated as:*

      \begin{equation}
      Commission_{j,i}(t) = C_j(t) \cdot \Delta s \cdot P_i(t)
      \end{equation}

Affiliates earn commissions based on some measure of their activity (not explicitly modeled in the provided code snippet for direct calculation within transactions, but the commission rate exists). The commission rate $C_j(t)$ for affiliate $j$ can dynamically adjust based on their past investment behavior and total earnings. The adjustment follows a set of predefined rules:

- The rate of adjustment is given by a dynamic adjustment rate.
- Adjustments happen at specific time step intervals.
- Commission rates have upper and lower bounds.

The goal is to simulate the evolution of this token economy over time, observing the changes in token prices, supplies, affiliate balances, and commission rates.

**Solution Approach (Simulation):**

The problem is solved through a discrete-time simulation. The simulation proceeds as follows:

1. **Initialization (t=0):**
   - Set initial supplies $S_i(0)$ and prices $P_i(0)$ for each token.
   - Assign initial bonding curve functions $f_i$ and parameters $\theta_i(0)$ for each token.
   - Set initial base currency balances $B_j(0)$, wallet balances $W_{j,i}(0)$, and commission rates $C_j(0)$ for each affiliate.

2. **Iteration (for t = 0 to T-1):**
   - **Affiliate Actions:** For each affiliate $j$, determine their actions for each token $i$ (buy, sell, or do nothing). The amount to buy or sell can be based on predefined strategies or randomness.
   - **Token Transactions:**  Update token supplies and affiliate balances based on the executed buy and sell transactions, applying the rules described in the problem statement.
   - **Price Calculation:** Recalculate the price of each token using its current bonding curve function and supply:
     $$P_i(t+1) = f_i(S_i(t+1), \theta_i(t))$$
     The code includes factors for demand and dampening, which can be incorporated as:
     $$P_i(t+1) = f_i(S_i(t+1), \theta_i(t)) \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot D_i(t))$$
     where $D_i(t)$ represents a demand factor and $\alpha$ is a sensitivity parameter.
   - **Bonding Curve Changes:** At predefined intervals, the bonding curve function $f_i$ and/or its parameters $\theta_i(t)$ for each token can change according to predefined rules or randomness.
   - **Commission Adjustment:** At predefined intervals, adjust the commission rates $C_j(t)$ for each affiliate based on their past performance (e.g., average investment, total earnings) according to predefined rules and bounds.

3. **Analysis:** After the simulation runs for $T$ steps, analyze the collected data, including:
   - Time series of token prices $P_i(t)$ and supplies $S_i(t)$.
   - Time series of affiliate base currency balances $B_j(t)$ and commission rates $C_j(t)$.
   - Distributions of final balances and commission rates.

**Mathematical Representation of Bonding Curves (Examples):**

The code provides several examples of bonding curve functions:

- **Linear:** $f(S) = m \cdot S + b$
- **Exponential:** $f(S) = a \cdot e^{k \cdot S}$
- **Sigmoid:** $f(S) = \frac{K}{1 + e^{-k(S - S_0)}}$
- **Root:** $f(S) = k \cdot \sqrt{S}$
- **Inverse:** $f(S) = \frac{k}{S + 1}$

The active bonding curve function $f_i$ for token $i$ at time $t$ is chosen from this set and its parameters are updated according to the simulation rules.

**Dynamic Commission Rate Adjustment (Mathematical Description):**

The commission rate $C_j(t)$ for affiliate $j$ is adjusted dynamically. Let $\Delta C_j(t)$ be the change in commission rate at time $t$. The adjustment can be described as:

$$\Delta C_j(t) = \begin{cases}
    +\delta_j & \text{if } \text{condition}_1 \\
    -\delta_j & \text{if } \text{condition}_2 \\
    0           & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where $\delta_j$ is the dynamic adjustment rate for affiliate $j$, which itself can depend on the affiliate's total earnings. The conditions are based on metrics like average recent investment. The commission rate is also bounded:

$$C_{min} \leq C_j(t) \leq C_{max}$$

**Output and Analysis:**

The simulation generates time series data that can be used to analyze the dynamics of the token economy. This includes:

- **Token Price and Supply Evolution:** Observe how prices and supplies change over time and how they are affected by bonding curve changes and market activity.
- **Affiliate Performance:** Track the growth of affiliate base currency balances and how commission rates evolve.
- **Market Stability:** Analyze the volatility of token prices and the overall stability of the simulated economy.

This mathematical formulation provides a framework for understanding and modeling the complex interactions within the simulated token economy. The simulation, as implemented in the Python code, serves as a computational method for exploring the behavior of this system under different conditions and parameter settings.
