Multi-Protocol Package

This package provides the infrastructure for running multiple cryptocurrency protocols
simultaneously within a unified simulation environment. It enables the analysis of
inter-protocol interactions, cross-protocol arbitrage, and ecosystem-wide dynamics.

The package includes:
- Orchestrator for parallel protocol execution
- Bridge management for inter-protocol communication
- Shared state management across protocols
- Example scenarios demonstrating multi-protocol integration

This framework allows researchers to study how different DeFi protocols interact,
compete, and affect each other within a larger ecosystem context.
