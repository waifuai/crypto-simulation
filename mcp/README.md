# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Interaction Simulation

## Overview

This simulation models the interactions within the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** ecosystem. MCP is an open standard designed to allow AI assistants and applications (MCP Hosts/Clients) to connect seamlessly with external tools and data sources (exposed via MCP Servers).

The goal of this simulation is to analyze the dynamics of these interactions under various conditions, exploring aspects like:

*   Server load balancing and resource allocation.
*   Efficiency of tool discovery and execution.
*   Impact of different client request patterns.
*   Scalability of the protocol with increasing numbers of clients, servers, tools, and resources.
*   Potential bottlenecks or failure modes.

## Core MCP Concepts Simulated

*   **MCP Hosts/Clients:** Simulated entities (representing AI applications, IDEs, etc.) that initiate requests for tools or resources via the protocol.
*   **MCP Servers:** Simulated entities that expose specific capabilities (tools and resources) according to the MCP standard. They handle incoming client requests.
*   **Tools:** Simulated external functions or APIs that MCP Servers can execute upon client request (e.g., running a calculation, querying a database). Tool execution may have associated costs or durations.
*   **Resources:** Simulated data sources or content that MCP Servers provide access to (e.g., files, API responses, database entries). Accessing resources might have associated latency or capacity limits.
*   **Protocol Interactions:** The simulation models the request/response flow between clients and servers, including tool invocation and resource retrieval based on the MCP specifications.

## Simulation Logic & Key Features

*(Note: This section assumes the underlying `main.py` simulates these aspects. Details should be verified against the code.)*

*   **Agent Behavior:**
    *   **Clients:** Generate requests for specific tools or resources based on defined patterns (e.g., frequency, complexity, target server/tool). May have priorities or budgets.
    *   **Servers:** Process incoming requests, manage queues, select appropriate tools/resources, simulate execution/access latency, and return responses/results. May have capacity limits.
*   **Network Dynamics:** Simulates potential network latency or constraints between clients and servers.
*   **Resource Management:** Models the availability, potential locking, and consumption of shared resources accessed via MCP servers.
*   **Tool Execution:** Simulates the time and potential computational cost associated with executing different tools.
*   **Parameterization:** Allows configuration of the number of clients, servers, tools, resources, request rates, server capacities, network conditions, etc.
*   **Metrics Collection:** Tracks key performance indicators like average request latency, server utilization, tool execution success/failure rates, resource contention, queue lengths, etc.

## How It Works (Conceptual Simulation Steps)

The simulation likely proceeds in discrete time steps. At each step:

1.  **Client Request Generation:** Clients determine if they need to make a request based on their internal state or probabilistic models.
2.  **Request Routing:** Clients send requests (potentially targeting specific servers or capabilities) through the simulated network.
3.  **Server Request Handling:** Servers receive requests, place them in queues if necessary, and begin processing based on available capacity.
4.  **Tool/Resource Interaction:** Servers simulate invoking the requested tool or accessing the requested resource, accounting for potential delays, costs, or failures.
5.  **Response Generation:** Servers formulate responses based on the outcome of the tool/resource interaction.
6.  **Response Routing:** Servers send responses back to the originating clients through the simulated network.
7.  **Client Response Processing:** Clients receive and process the responses.
8.  **State Updates & Metrics:** Global state (server loads, resource availability) is updated, and performance metrics are recorded.

## Parameters (Example - Needs Verification)

*(These are *examples* of parameters relevant to an MCP simulation. The actual parameters in `main.py` must be confirmed.)*

*   `NUM_CLIENTS`: Number of MCP client agents.
*   `NUM_SERVERS`: Number of MCP server agents.
*   `NUM_TOOLS_PER_SERVER`: Average number of tools exposed by each server.
*   `NUM_RESOURCES_PER_SERVER`: Average number of resources exposed by each server.
*   `CLIENT_REQUEST_RATE`: Average frequency of requests per client.
*   `SERVER_CAPACITY`: Maximum concurrent requests a server can handle.
*   `AVG_TOOL_EXECUTION_TIME`: Average simulated time for tool execution.
*   `AVG_RESOURCE_ACCESS_TIME`: Average simulated time for resource access.
*   `NETWORK_LATENCY`: Simulated network delay.
*   `SIMULATION_STEPS`: Duration of the simulation.

## Experimentation

*(This section needs updating based on the actual experiments performed in `main.py`. The previous description focused on economic parameters.)*

The script may include functionality to systematically vary key MCP-related parameters (e.g., `SERVER_CAPACITY`, `CLIENT_REQUEST_RATE`) and visualize their impact on simulation outcomes like average latency or throughput.

## Running the Code

*(Dependency check needed - `numpy` and `matplotlib` are likely still relevant for analysis, but others might be needed for the simulation logic itself).*

To run the simulation, you need Python 3 and potentially libraries like `numpy` and `matplotlib`.

Install dependencies (verify requirements):
```bash
# Example: Update this based on actual requirements
pip install --user numpy matplotlib 
# Check if mcp/requirements.txt exists and is relevant
# pip install --user -r requirements.txt 
```

Execute the simulation (verify command-line arguments):
```bash
# Example: Update this based on actual arguments in main.py
python main.py --num_clients 50 --num_servers 5 --request_rate 0.5 
```
The script will run the simulation, potentially outputting results to the console, data files (e.g., `output.txt`), or generating plots.

## Repository Contents

*(This needs verification - `math.md` is likely irrelevant now).*

*   `main.py`: The main Python script containing the MCP simulation code.
*   `output.txt`: (If generated) Contains simulation output data.
*   `*.png`: (If generated) Plots visualizing simulation results.
*   `docs/`: (If exists) May contain further documentation specific to the MCP simulation implementation.
*   `notebook/`: (If exists) May contain Jupyter notebooks for analysis or exploration.
